/**
 * Live AI Search uploader: the operator half of ingestion.
 *
 * scripts/ingest.ts deliberately ships an unimplemented uploader so that no test, and no
 * harness run, can ever put bytes into the live index. This module supplies the real one,
 * and is only constructed when the CLI is run without --dry-run AND credentials are present.
 *
 * Wire format, established empirically against the live API rather than from the docs alone:
 *
 *   POST /accounts/{acct}/ai-search/namespaces/{ns}/instances/{id}/items   (multipart)
 *     file      the document. Its FILENAME becomes the item key, and the key is not
 *               otherwise settable -- so the filename must be `{source_id}.md` / `.pdf`,
 *               which is the convention src/retrieve.ts documents.
 *     metadata  a JSON string of the provenance fields. These are retained only because
 *               the instance declares them in `custom_metadata`; an undeclared field is
 *               dropped with a `custom_metadata_field_not_filterable` warning.
 *
 * TWO TRAPS, both of which cost real time to find:
 *
 *  1. `metadata` reads back as null at upload time and for some seconds after. It appears
 *     once indexing starts. A null metadata immediately after upload is NOT a failure --
 *     do not "fix" it by changing the request.
 *  2. Passing the document as a JSON-valued form field (`-F file='{"file":...}'`, which is
 *     what the API reference's example shows) fails with `file_field_is_required`. A real
 *     multipart file part is mandatory.
